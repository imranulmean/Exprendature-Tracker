//////////////Upload Files to google drive////////////////////
Step 1: Create the Project and Enable the API
	1.Go to the Google Cloud Console. https://console.cloud.google.com/

	2.At the top left (next to the "Google Cloud" logo), click the Project Dropdown and select New Project. Name it "My Drive Uploader" and click Create.

	3.Once the project is created, make sure it is selected in that same top dropdown.
	 
	4.Go to the Google Drive API Library. https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com

	5.Click the blue Enable button.

Step 2: Setup the OAuth Consent Screen (Crucial) 
	This is where most people get stuck. You have to tell Google that you are allowed to use your own app.

	1.Go to the OAuth Consent Screen. https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent

	2.Select User Type: External and click Create.

	3.App Information:

	4.App name: "My Node Uploader"

	5.User support email: Select your Gmail.

	6.Developer contact info: Type your Gmail again.

	7.Click Save and Continue.

	8.Scopes: Click Add or Remove Scopes. In the filter box, type drive. Check the box for .../auth/drive (the one that says "See, edit, create, and delete all of your Google Drive files"). Click Update and then Save and Continue.

	9.Test Users: Click + ADD USERS. Type your exact Gmail address. If you skip this, you will get an "Access Blocked" error later. Click Save and Continue.

Step 3: Create the "Keys" (Credentials)
	1.Go to the Credentials Page. https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

	2.Click + CREATE CREDENTIALS at the top and select OAuth client ID.

	3.Application type: Select Web application.

	4.Name: You can leave it as "Web client 1".

	5.Authorized redirect URIs: Click + ADD URI and paste this exactly: https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground

	6.Click Create. A popup will show your Client ID and Client Secret. Copy these and save them in a Notepad.

Step 4: Get the Refresh Token
	Since your Node.js app doesn't have a "Login with Google" button, we use the OAuth Playground to get a permanent key.

	1.Go to OAuth 2.0 Playground. https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/

	2.On the right side, click the Settings icon (cog wheel).

	3.Check the box "Use your own OAuth credentials".

	4.Paste your Client ID and Client Secret that you just saved. Click Close.

	5.On the left side (Step 1), scroll down to Drive API v3. Click the arrow to expand it.

	6.Select https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.

	7.Click the blue Authorize APIs button. It will take you to a Google Login page. Log in with your Gmail and click Continue/Allow when it warns you the app isn't verified.

	8.Back on the Playground (Step 2), click the blue Exchange authorization code for tokens button.

	You will now see a Refresh Token box. Copy that token. This is the "Master Key" for your Node.js code.
